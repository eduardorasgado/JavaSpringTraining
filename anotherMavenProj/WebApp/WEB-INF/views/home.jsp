		The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern 
		Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform.
		</p>
		<p>
		A key element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application level: 
		Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams can focus on 
		application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to specific deployment environments.
